# Executive summary

- Collaborations between open communities and social impact-focused organizations often involve aims and goals different from those between for-profit or shareholder-driven organizations.
- Integrating open organizational principles into social impact-focused organizations helps advocates to place communities' needs and desires at the center of their work.
- Increasingly, open advocates feel empowered to lead initiatives and campaigns with deep social and ecological impacts, but they cannot do this without creating coalitions of participants acting with open organizational principles in mind.
- Open advocates serve as "bridges" or liaisons between allied communities, projects, and initiatives.
- Open advocates succeed by finding common linguistic and value frameworks that unite seemingly disparate groups.
- Open advocates can build Architectures of Participation and Communication Ecosystems to align stakeholders on critical work.
- Setting strategy for newly formed open organizations focused on social impacts involves sketching unifying principles, making effective connections between allies, and establishing clear structures.
- Stakeholders can share their mission, vision, and values statements to find points of critical overlap that might galvanize their work.
- Making connections with potential allies involves listening deeply and critical to others' needs.
- Organizational leaders tend to find comfort in structure, so open advocates can minimize the stress of change by document and making transparent their transformation plans.

## Introduction
For years, we've been working at the intersection of the technology industry and social impact-focused organizations (humanitarian, development, non-profit, activists, civil society, etc.), helping communities catalyze impact via open principles. Like all communities, those communities are made of people, and out of respect for them and their access to an ecosystem of knowledge we listen closely and build collaboratively. For us, the social impact space is a place in which principled, human behaviors exist alongside an abiding love of technology, a passion for social impact, and belief in the power of open source. Living by open organization principles—transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—can be difficult.

However, over the years we've brought this passion and belief to others, and we've failed at changing the hearts and minds of people in this space. We've learned some important lessons about work, the social impact space, humanity, and ourselves.

First, we've learned that this space requires a specific kind of conversation. It's a place where actions aren't concentrated on goals like "monetizing a user base" or "creating a lucrative exit strategy," but rather on missions like promoting health; achieving peace; and fostering respect for ourselves, each other, and our planet. Where technological challenges intersect with issues of social justice and ecological import, technologists and social impact-focused organizations alike are attempting to mold the future of a digital world with sustainable impacts—all in an inclusive manner respectful of people's lived experiences. This is a conversation about much more than "open code" or "open data"; indeed, it's about more than "open source." It's a conversation about the ways *technologies alone* won't truly make our world better—since tools, after all, always already exist in complex, pre-existing arrangements of people, power, and communities. This is a conversation about changing our everyday thinking about "work" or how people collaborate, listen, and include others. It is also about the ways people relate to and embody a their own sense of civic participation. Importantly, this is also about people and their mindsets and behaviors, so it's a conversation that's deeply contextualized.

Second, we've learned that this conversation involves specific kinds of voices. It unites "true believers" in open and agile methodologies with people who have interests and skills in everything from environmental conservation to humanitarian crises, from critical incident management to digital forensics, and motivate measurable impact on the improvement of people's lives. More and more, especially due to the global pandemic, people who haven't identified as "activists" or "change agents" are being empowered to participate in imagining, designing, and executing campaigns and activities with deep social and ecological impacts. They aren't lacking in ideas. What they need are some shared resources and coordinating principles, and someone to help them learn what those principles look like in action.

We believe open principles are those principles, and that a new generation of open advocates are the people to continue and improve upon our work. Helping to open up social impact-focused organizations is the best way for us to create sustainable change, and if you're working on that same challenge, then we're eager to help you on your way.

To be clear: this work is very difficult. It requires ample resilience, peer-support, and strength. Taking a systems-focused approach to changing the way our systems work from the inside is no task for the meek; it's a lifelong endeavor in the spirit of efficacy, justice, inclusivity, diversity, equity, and empathy. Behavioral and organizational transformation can feel like a roller coaster—something requiring ever-changing sets of skills, inexhaustible will, and robust futureproofing.

It also requires letting go of some deeply held convictions about individualism and independence. Conventional organizational discourses tell a familiar story: *Climb the ladder. Allow ego and natural instincts for self-preservation to guide us.* Working openly forces us to face new insights into the social and cultural norms that make transformation difficult. It's time to explore the emotional and social side of open community building and examine more closely the leadership traits management should develop.

This is our perspective on how open advocates can work within the social impact-focused space. More than a manifesto, we mean for it to be a practical guide, offering strategies and mindsets to help people and organizations flourish by learning to modify people's practices in light of cultural (and subcultural) nuances. We'll examine some of the tools we have to support and facilitate this work. But we'll also argue for a shared set of values and principles to unite our collective efforts—to light a way forward, championing openness for greater organizational impact. ◕

## Inspirations
Incremental approaches lead to incremental change—in behaviors, in plans, and in the fabric of organizations. Let's start with some examples. 

In this tactical guide, you'll find examples of tools and behaviors that can help activists inspire changes to fundamental organizational systems, structures, and processes—changes often necessary to ensure that the mission activists have devoted themselves to is front and center in all they do, and that institutional politics, unhealthy power balances, or stodgy hierarchical models don't adversely impact the people who are driving positive change in our world. But before we launch into this guide for coalition building and solidarity using open principles in this space, and before we offer some advice on creating impact, let's have a look at a few initiatives that have proven successful and explore the reality of that success.

### IFRC Digital Transformation Strategy
*Transforming strategy and policy*

Across the global, federated International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), many products, services, and programs have included components supporting greater openness, but no specific strategy or policy documents mentioned open principles explicitly. One IFRC project from 2016, the GO platform, utilized an open technology stack, building on the use of OpenDataKit and Kobo.[^go-platform] It was the catalyst for the organization's first-ever data literacy program, which fostered to support digital transformation using open methods. IFRC joined Missing Maps[^missing-maps] (part of the wider Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT).[^humanitarian-openstreetmap] Crafted for teams to learn about data literacy, open data, and open collaboration, the IFRC Data Playbook is an extensive, collaboratively written toolkit.[^ifrc-data-playbook]

[ed note - revised] The IFRC built on the learning from these initiatives and elsewhere in its network to develop a new Strategy 2030, which mobilized participation across its diverse network and whose early research shows alignment with open principles, and a strategy specifically dedicated to Digital Transformation as one of the seven transformations identified in in Strategy 2030.[5] By working out loud, convening like minds, and fostering a shared journey, the organization’s narrative around openness became concrete as clear global examples surfaced. So did the organization’s open agenda.
 

Getting "open" into a global strategy for the largest humanitarian network in the world was a team sport. By using research, insights, and examples—plus products and services—the narrative that open principles are design principles and open methods should be part of the "menu" for digital transformation as national societies and the IFRC Secretariat made its way into implementation plans. The International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent Societies' Digital Transformation strategy, as approved by the IFRC Governing Board in May 2021, includes open source and open data as proposed approaches.[^digital-transformation-society]

### Greenpeace Planet 4
*Transforming community and product*

 Greenpeace is another example of a network of organizations featuring several "open" components well before the concept made it into a more "official" strategy or policy. In 2015, Greenpeace International found itself at a cultural crossroads. As part of a strategy to shift the organizational narrative back to its roots, the organization committed to building its first fully free and open source project: Planet 4, a global platform that could support the work of the organization and help everyday people make a positive impact in fighting the climate crisis. The project started with a small group of people who knew that building a global product would be most successful if a community of people built it together. With community-driven governance and processes, open advocates started a journey that would bring people across that global Greenpeace network together, united around a piece of technology with an inspiring vision.[^planet-4-series] Today, the platform runs nearly all of Greenpeace global web presences. The community that formed around it is made up of representatives from many, many Greenpeace national and regional offices, and it continues to thrive.[^planet-4-community] The open principles that started the project continue to gain traction both inside and outside of the organization.

### Catalyst
*Transforming networks and education*

In 2019, the Centre for the Acceleration of Social Technology (CAST) provided space for a network of organizations and people eager to help charities respond to a changing landscape. They named the endeavor "Catalyst," as this community was on "a mission to support, or catalyze, the transformation of civil society via the power of digital, data and design."[^catalyst] When the global pandemic threw many of the world's organizations into the throes of digital transformation, this network responded with a variety of funding opportunities that brought local charities and technologists together. Digital agencies and technologists used open principles to teach social impact charities the skills, processes, and technologies that could help them help others. ◕

## Building coalitions

How can we put the community at the center of our work and move in step with our allies?

Probably the most important lesson we've learned over the course of our careers is the power and importance of finding allies. Going at it alone is simply not an option for the open advocate working in this space.
 
That's because movements transcend individuals and institutions. But clearly, people are at the center of them. As an open advocate, you must be a fire starter, keen network builder, strong listener and documenter—and *then* you need to locate those who can help spread the fire.

### Being a bridge, conducting the movement

Think of an open advocate as a liaison between the social impact and technology communities. Leadership stakeholders will often determine the extent to which you can align more abstract open organizational models to align change with any organization's goals or needs, so you'll need to act as a bridge between them and everyone else in the organization. Becoming that bridge allows you to intertwine various communities of interest through your work. And as this bridge, you'll need to work from multiple sides; you'll need to work *both* with kindred spirits in technology communities *and* with allies in the non-profit or governmental organization(s) with whom you're working.

To succeed, you'll need to become a keen observer of organizational culture. You'll need to "manage up" and help people along the journey. It all requires you to listen, research, reframe, and be humble. Throughout your work, you will rethink your image of fair and inclusive consultations. You'll consider how "open" can augment and support existing efforts without just "open washing" them. And you'll conduct some deep work, often resetting the organization's culture and contexts.

Moreover, you'll need to learn to coordinate people with just enough structure to keep them productive. A strong "movement" often feels like something that functions somewhere between an orchestra and a progressive jazz trio: not quite perfectly conducted, not quite improvisational.

### Identifying allies

Good allies—in any community—are those who understand the complex systems in which we work and live. Finding them means finding collaborators interested in helping you explore fundamental questions like:

- How can we create an environment that enables people to get involved in the issue or challenge we're trying to address?
- What has worked in the past? What didn't work before?
- How does something align with the existing work? What are the shared narratives, outcomes and/or mandates?
- What is the scale of our collective endeavor?
- Who is engaged and what are the problems we are solving in this context?

Perhaps the most important question of all is: *How can we put the community at the center of our activities, conversations, and solutions (products/services)?* To have impact (and therefore to do something that matters) we need to acknowledge that systems are complex, perspectives vary, and no two communities are exactly the same. We need to understand and accept that each solution we create will be different, that we'll need help along the way, and that the best way to receive is to give.
 
To build community, you'll need to meet people where they are. You'll need to be passionate about your thing, but also curious about theirs. You'll need to check your privilege, open your advocacy heart and your own worldview. Often, the way to "open" is more about being gracious, available to listen, and capable of finding common points of collaboration while truly adapting to the context and communities you engage. As a bonus, understanding different groups' needs, passions, motivations, and use cases is how we make programs and products better.

### Starting small and cutting across

As you build coalitions, you'll start small and expand. Over the course of your involvement in this field, this will never change.

Networks and allies are essential to negotiating change. Coalition building involves balancing a sliding scale of needs. We often start with doing some basic mapping, asking ourselves "Who else is doing work in this space? Who is an advocate?" Then we look for the "wedge," a common interest we can use to connect *our* initiative to *another* group or network. Sometimes, that common interest is easy to see. Other times, finding it means *broadening* the scope of your own interest to draw together people who can influence each other as they build networks, products, and services. And other times, an imaginative and inspiring story can be the thread that holds people together.

Consistent engagement with your community and documentation of your work together is extraordinarily important.[^community-documentation] We often use a framework we developed, an Architecture of Participation, to make sure we've covered all our bases when thinking about volunteering, contributing, and facilitating communities.[^architecture-participation] Consistent engagement will result in shared talking points around "open"—products, services, insights, and methods. Together, build a shared agenda for impact and coalesce on the "things we can do." Advocate together!

An ad hoc network like this—indeed a coalition built from the ground up—will cross-cut topics, regions, organizations, and existing networks. By having common talking points, you'll be able to support each other and find alignment. The same documentation can be used to influence senior leaders and provide talking points for "digital and data" efforts. Use examples from your work and align them with the strategy and organizational themes such as localization and resilience.

The work of incorporating openness into social impact-focused work can be a slog. However, much like our counterparts in the InnerSource network and the cooperative economy, we see potential to make hybrids that suit the models and cultures of an organization while retaining open values and principles.

There is no interagency subcommittee on open source for social impact-focused responses. There is no network of civil society/humanitarian/tech organizations in open source. There is only a loosely connected community of contemporaries who are quietly bridging open source and an industry that exists to tackle global problems. ◕
 
#### Three tips for building open coalitions

1. **Support and mentorship**: Open advocates need to recognize and support the work social impact-focused allies are trying to do, then draw connections to the open values and principles that unite them. Open advocates collaborate with loosely connected, highly aligned networks.
2. **Sustainable balance**: Coalitions need organized and sustainable approaches, including simple things like documentation and open processes. Establishing supportive structures, like Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), using familiar processes and frameworks, while shining the light on new examples and insights, can help balance the intensity of this work.[^ospo-guide]
3. **Getting there**: This space needs more advocacy, research, and overall collaboration—beyond the work of writing code. Talk about your journey, and know that we are here to support you. There are OSPOs, InnerSource commons, and products and services available across many impact--focused organizations. However, we note a gap in research about ways to implement open organization methods in social impact-focused groups (hence this *Open Perspective*).

## Setting strategy

You've connected networks and built a coalition. Now it's time to coordinate and act. In social impact-focused organizations, you will likely need to advocate on multiple levels. Here's some advice for doing that.

Once you've found some allies, you'll set to work figuring out how to collectively advocate for openness. Strategy will play a key role here—not just your *personal* strategy for advancing the work, but also the *organizational* strategy you'll need to mold to support the work.

Beginning this work can feel daunting. Sometimes, the right approach is to gather people together and see what emerges *before* establishing a more formal strategy. That's certainly an approach that has worked for many user-centered products. With an idea for impact and some insightful user research, a product can catalyze the strategic shifts in behaviors and mindsets required to inch closer to a particular outcome. And if the product team understands participatory methodologies and/or human-centered design, a product can be the trojan horse for shifting *organizational cultures*.

Other times, a commitment to open principles paired with a lust for learning can lead to a strategic vision that envelopes openness as a core component. A strategy paper can help you advocate for openness in a way that may feel safer for the people inside the social impact-focused organization you're working with.

More often than not, open advocates in these spaces consult and collaborate with shallow pools of resources and funding. Your audacity alone must support new ways of working in distributed teams and lift people up to work across programs and borders. In general, we recommend a three-piece framework for helping your coalition establish its strategy:

- Sketching unifying principles
- Making effective connections
- Establishing basic structures

Let's examine each.

### Unifying principles

As the Open Organization project notes in the Open Organization Definition: "Openness is becoming increasingly central to the ways groups and teams of all sizes are working together to achieve shared goals. And today, the most forward-thinking organizations—whatever their missions—are embracing openness as a necessary orientation toward success."[^open-organization-definition] But that doesn't mean that radical openness isn't frightening to people and cultures who haven't yet experienced it. In this social impact-focused space, successful strategy often involves *opening up organizational cultures*. Here it helps to map open principles to the organization's already existing values, or to the network with which you're working. A healthy, shared common language and distributed ownership is essential.

Every organization is different. But in line with the Open Organization Definition, we believe five key characteristics are the preconditions conditions for openness:

- Transparency
- Inclusivity
- Adaptability
- Collaboration
- Community

Revealing how these characteristics map to the fundamental principles of your organization is part of the work. For example, the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement has seven fundamental principles:

- Humanity
- Impartiality
- Unity
- Neutrality
- Independence
- Volunteer service
- Universality[^ifrc-principles]

The international cooperative principles are:

- Voluntary and Open Membership
- Democratic Member Control
- Member Economic Participation
- Autonomy and Independence
- Education, Training, and Information
- Cooperation among Cooperatives
- Concern for Community[^international-cooperative-principles]

While the semantics in each of these examples are inevitably different, for us it's clear that community and inclusivity are key. Autonomy and independence *infer* that an individual is "allowed" to be adaptable and human. Neutrality is achievable through transparency. Volunteering and cooperating are forms of collaboration. We don't wish to insinuate that semantics aren't important; indeed, the converse is very much true in the social impact-focused space. To advocate for openness in this industry, you have to find ways to use principles and language as a mechanism for unifying various perspectives on and ideas about openness that might be driving the organization.

### Making connections

Open advocates must use both *language* and *tactics* that their stakeholders—from social entrepreneurs to technology companies to academics to large non-profit organizations and NGOs—understand. At the same time, these advocates must work in a way that respects the aims, goals, and backgrounds of the people with whom they're working. To do this, you need to *connect* to disparate groups and use language suitable to them. Through this lens of "connection," then, you might begin to join some puzzle pieces (e.g., open source, open data, and open mapping) to better support social impact-focused work.

Put simply, you'll need to be in the spaces and places where humanitarians and activists are *doing the work*. Luckily, this is an opportune time for making these connections. Many social impact-focused organizations are playing "catch up" in their digital transformation efforts, building relationships to new technologies that require new organizational processes, too. For open advocates, this need represents an opportunity to interject openness into new system- and structure-building activities. It'll require deep learning on ways everyone might better collaborate and coordinate (not to mention more patience and more resilience). It means exploring new models of partnerships, volunteering, and collaborating in distributed networks. But the results can be impressive.

Making connections in this space is not just about building coalitions and working with your allies; it's also about *listening deeply* to the things other people are doing. You'll want to join organizational initiatives that might look more "traditional" or "conventional." As you do, pay attention to the projects and programs people inside your organization are talking about. Once you begin to pay attention to other people's projects, you'll find numerous ways to draw connections between your initiative and others. This is also an excellent way to find more allies. People appreciate it when others pay attention to what they're doing!

### Establishing structures

People in this space tend to appreciate structure, formality, and meetings. They form working groups and steering committees. They don't often understand "ad hoc" as a useful model or structure, so you'll need to work to provide those coalition-building structures and processes for people. You can organize formal meetings, but use participatory and open design methods. Use hybrids and allow leaders to see people speaking and enjoying themselves while they're doing the work. Nothing impresses leaders like a productive and enthusiastic team.

Creating and documenting your structures and processes so that others can easily reference them will give your project an extra leg to lean on when things get tricky. Openness happens with us, and we should be modeling the building of open systems with our social impact principles. Using pre-existing frameworks and applying them to your specific context—perhaps by publishing an Architecture of Participation or establishing a Communication Ecosystem—will help you engage with others.[^communication-ecosystem] You should publish your ideas and plans unabashedly.

At minimum, you'll want to outline the following:

- **What are you trying to achieve and why?** Write it down and refer back to it often.
- **How and where are you doing the work?** Document your ways of working and do it in the open. What tools do you use? How often do you meet?
- **Who's on the team?** Who are your allies? Celebrate them in public.

As you look for various connections, use your established structures to communicate regularly so people inside the organization learn *what* the structures for engagement *are*. Be relentless as you talk about other people's work and the ways it's made you think about your own efforts.
Ask questions and be curious.

Building strategy as you work openly will come with ups and downs, but it is essential for convincing hearts and minds in social impact-focused organizations. ◕

#### Three tips for setting open strategy

1. **Open leadership**: Don't just write it down; *show* how collective, decentralized project structures with multiple leaders benefit the community and the organization. Be an open leader and work to be a better leader. Always.
2. **Open engagement**: Publish early and often, invite people in, default to open, and engage with people as an open leader. Talk about how you see openness relating to the mission or principles of the organization.
3. **Open mindsets**: Offer and receive professional development on things like trust, taking ownership, and spreading duties and responsibilities to the edges so everyone feels engaged and connected. Ask for help and feedback; reach out to voices who aren't already represented in your discussions and in your work.

## Take heart

Change—of any kind—always involves friction, and friction can feel like backlash. Keep your spirits up.

In the introduction to this *Open Perspective*, we mentioned that this work is difficult. In fact, we used the words "very difficult." We know from our many years of experience that countless social injustices we organize to fight against are mirrored inside organizations both large and small. Careerism, egoism, individualism, sexism, racism, ageism, and ableism exist inside so many organizations. As you work, remember: the source of so much injustice is fear, and promoting open principles can stimulate people's fears. You will need to stand up for yourself and for others. You will need inexhaustible will. You will need to remember that it is not the collective that commits acts of injustice and bad weeds can be weeded out or cut down.

Like any change, transformation and innovation approaches are by their very nature friction-based. Organizational and behavioral change is hard and uncomfortable. While open advocates might be "comfortable with being uncomfortable" throughout the flow of change, this is not an easy adjustment for all. Owning the innovation and transformation ethos means being mindful that open advocates might experience some backlash—push-back from that friction—on this journey.

You'll need ample resilience, peer support and strength—so *do not forget to find your allies*. Join online groups designed for emotional processing. Talk to people about your real feelings. Get frustrated and rant to a trusted friend about your work. You'll need to protect yourself if you are to do this work for the long term. There is much suffering in the world, and as social impact-focused organizations are often created to address this, you're very likely to be face to face with a wide variety of off-kilter situations.

Yet openness is essential for making the world a better place. Collaboration and community are no longer "nice to haves" or "maybes." While not all digital technology needs to be open *source*, we do need to shift to more open *work* to address the global problems we face. In the social impact-focused space, we need people with a variety of skills, people who can shoulder the accountability for a community. As we transform our organizations, we need to put openness at the center of everything we do, and we need to ensure that our organizations take these shifts seriously.

"Open" comes in many versions. The concept isn't part of a binary ("open" versus "closed"). It's contextual, and always existing somewhere on a continuum. And advocates must apply it mindfully. We haven't mentioned so many groups and projects, frameworks and ideas from the world of social impact-focused open organizations. This work is ultimately about people, so what advocating for openness looks and feels like will vary culture to culture, organization to organization, space to space.

If we could identify a single, outstanding lesson we'd like you to take from this discussion, it's that you are not alone. After 40 years of combined experience, we can assure you that there are open advocates dedicated to such a wide variety of spaces and intentions. There are guides and frameworks and organizing principles, like the Principles for Digital Development.[^principles-digital-development] There are associations and existing alliances.[^digital-public-goods] There's much to support you as you promote openness, and more is emerging all the time.

So what are your next steps? If this *Open Perspective* resonated with you—if you found yourself inspired, enlightened, terrified, or otherwise moved—then we'd very much like to know what you think.
