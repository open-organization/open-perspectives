# Open Perspectives

Open Perspectives is a series of short, timely, and openly licensed publications from the Open Organization project. Issues feature voices from our community of experts on open organizational culture, design, and leadership as they explore what they consider the most pertinent and pressing issues facing modern organizationsâ€”and explain how open principles can help us address those issues.
