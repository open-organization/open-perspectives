The Open Organization project is pleased to announce the launch of Open Perspectives, a series of short, timely, and openly licensed publications featuring voices from our community of experts on open organizational culture, design, and leadership as they explore what they consider the most pertinent and pressing issues facing modern organizations—and explain how open principles can help us address those issues.

The series commences with new writing from Open Organization Ambassador Jos Groen (@JosGroen). In "Opening Up to Leadership Talent," Jos explains how open principles can serve as the foundation for talent management—particularly in hybrid organizations transitioning from conventional organizational structures and cultures to open ones. Built as a practical guide, this Open Perspective on talent management is for anyone constructing a more dynamic—and humane—place to work.

The work is available [for immediate download](https://github.com/open-organization/open-perspectives/raw/main/opening-up-to-leadership-talent/opening-up-to-leadership-talent.pdf).

As always, the community invites your comment and contribution.
