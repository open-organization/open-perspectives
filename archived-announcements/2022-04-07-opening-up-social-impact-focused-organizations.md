The Open Organization community is pleased to announce the release of a new issue in the *Open Perspectives* series: *Opening Up Social Impact-Focused Organizations.

In *Opening Up Social Impact-Focused Organizations*, authors Laura Hilliger and Heather Leson pool their years of experience in non-profit, humanitarian, and social impact-focused organizations, offering guidance for leaders working to transform their organizations with open principles in mind. With advice that's both refreshingly realistic and eminently practical, Laura and Heather explain how working openly can help advocates for social change build coalitions, create projects that respect communities' values, and architect durable movements with far-reaching impacts.

From the guide:

> This is our perspective on how open advocates can work within the social impact-focused space. More than a manifesto, we mean for it to be a practical guide, offering strategies and mindsets to help people and organizations flourish by learning to modify people’s practices in light of cultural (and subcultural) nuances. We’ll examine some of the tools we have to support and facilitate this work. But we’ll also argue for a shared set of values and principles to unite our collective efforts— to light a way forward, championing openness for greater organizational impact.

This *Open Perspective* is available immediately at the Open Organization project's repository on GitHub, or via these direct links:
